## Overview
### Description

Are you the kind of person who sends 10-minute voice messages to your friends investigating the nature of things or making jokes that could totally be in a stand-up comedy show?

If so, this app is for you.
 
Project Voyage is an app based on Automated Speech Recognition (ASR). It transcribes voice messages to text, allowing the user to produce, and manipulate it as they wish, a written dialogue between two people. The user can then export the dialogue in Markdown so they can copy and paste it in their favorite notetaking app.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Self-cognition
- **Mobile:** Yes, sir. Mobile is fundamental here because it is the most direct from of sending voice messages. PCs have the disadvantage of having to download the voice message. Plus, most transcription apps on app store are too purpose broad.
- **Story:** Users will be able to transcribe their conversations that contains voice messages and export them forever.
- **Market:** Self-improvement
- **Habit:** The app might assist and integrate the personal habit of sending meaningful voice messages to people, while being able to regularly retrieve information from these messages. 
- **Scope:** On the most basic level, the user should be able to upload a voice message directly from WhatsApp and have it displayed in screen as a message bubble to copy and paste in raw text. Users can also import written messages from WhatsApp if it helps complementing a dialogue. They can also edit any of the text of all parties in the dialogue as they wish. In cybernetic terms, they have requisite variety over all existing symbols in the dialogue.
